# HelpEscape
Using search to formulate a plan that R2-D2 can follow to escape. An optimal plan is one with as few steps as possible. The following search algorithms is implemented and each will be used to help R2-D2:<br/>
a) Breadth-first search.<br/>
b) Depth-first search.<br/>
c) Iterative deepening search.<br/>
d) Uniform-cost search.<br/>
e) Greedy search with at least two heuristics.<br/>
f) A âˆ— search with at least two admissible heuristics.
